#This is an example of how to use every info type and bang from version 1.0 or the GPMDPplugin
#Currently I have not setup support to get the rating of the current song this is planned for the next version
#After that if there is demand I may add the ability to get the upcoming songs info and/or the lyrics of the current song

#Example of how to get the title of the current song, if GPMDP has no song selected or it is closed it will be a blank string.

#1 is the websocket it open but commands like play and pause wont work, note the plugin will be in this state for a split second while the websocket remote is still authenticating 
#2 is the websocket is open and has remote access, so things like play pause and skip will work
